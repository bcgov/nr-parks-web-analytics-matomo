# NR Parks Web Analytics - Matomo Deployment Infrastructure

This repository provides Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations for deploying Matomo Analytics across multiple cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and OpenShift. It supports various IaC tools such as Terraform, AWS CDK, Helm, and Kustomize, enabling flexible, scalable, and secure deployments tailored to different environments.

## 🎯 Project Status

⚠️ Please Note: This repository is currently under development. As of now, only the implementation for AWS using CDK is complete and functional. The other platforms and tools described in this README represent the planned future state of the project.

🌐 Supported Platforms & Tools
AWS
Terraform: (Planned) Declarative provisioning of AWS resources.

AWS CDK: (Available) TypeScript-based infrastructure definitions.

GCP
Terraform: (Planned) Infrastructure provisioning for GCP.

Deployment Manager: (Planned) Native GCP IaC tool.

OpenShift
Helm: (Planned) Package manager for Kubernetes applications.

Kustomize: (Planned) Template-free customization of Kubernetes YAML.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Currently, only deployment via AWS CDK is supported. The other examples are for future implementations.

### Prerequisites

AWS CLI / GCP SDK / OpenShift CLI

Terraform CLI

Node.js & npm (for CDK)

Helm & Kustomize (for OpenShift)

Python (optional for scripting)

### Example: Deploying to AWS with CDK (Available)

```shell
cd aws/cdk
npm install
cdk synth
cdk deploy
```

### Example: Deploying to AWS with Terraform (Planned)

> This is not yet implemented

```shell
cd aws/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Example: Deploying to OpenShift with Helm (Planned)

> This is not yet implemented

```shell
cd openshift/helm
helm install matomo ./matomo-chart
```

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

HTTPS via ACM or cert-manager

IAM roles and policies (AWS)

Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets

Optional integrations: RDS, CloudFront, Route53, GCS, OpenShift Routes
